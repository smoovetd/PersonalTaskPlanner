				Personal Task Planner
				  by Boyan Blagiev

1. Idea - write personal task planner. User could keep track of its tasks. Can sort then by status, category, due date and creation date. 
Program will store items in a file with possible update for multy-user usage with DB to store application info.
GUI will be console with commands, that will be handled by command dispatcher. After that ill be updated with Form and web site.

2. Solution - I think that it is good beginning to create this application to be as Getting Things Done (GDT) system. I found very interesting the following link:
http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-getting-things-done-1551880955 . The app will contain the following:

Common characteristics of all Items:
		* Start Date
		* Summary 
		* Description
		* Type
			> Goal
        		> List
        		> Task (def)
			> Project
                        > Habit
			> Idea
         	* Status
		




Priority:	
		* IMMEDIATE - cease other work and start working on this
		* HIGH
		* MEDIUM
		* LOW
